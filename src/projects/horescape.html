			<h3>proj.Unity game</h3>
			<h3>Name: Horescape———PC escapes from monster’s chasing, in an abandoned hospital.</h3>
			<p>Mobile Game, control methods, swipe up-jump, swipe down-lay down, swipe right- move right, swipe left- move left.</p>
			<br>
			<p>
	        Contrary to common running games, which we usually see our Hero on its backside and running away from us, we made him run toward us.
			</p>
			<p>
			Running is continuous, no need to be controlled, and the game is endless till die.
			</p>
			<p>
			The main Enemy is a Monster chasing on the back and will jump and hit protagonist every once in a while. When get attacked, the blood value will decrease. The player can control hero to jump to increase pace or move aside to evade.
			</p>
			<p>
			On his way running, we set obstacles and energy bar. There were two kinds of obstacles.
			One is hands suddenly stretch out from either side of walls. Our hero has to evade by moving to right or left or
			downside. When hit by hands, his blood value will reduce, till 0;
			The other is trap. The player needs to ctrl hero jump to avoid falling down，which will directly lead to the end of game.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			We also performed supplement pills to pick up. When pills appear, player ctrl him to move, left, right or stay, and when character touches the pill, there will be a “picking up” animation, as well as blood value increases.
			And we also set integration. The calculation method is as the time goes up, the increase speed of points will also increase, like below 10, 1 by 1 increasing, and under 20, 2 by 2, and so on.
			</p>
			<p>
				For obstacles, we created 6 kinds of tiles and made them appear randomly. 6 tiles are left+trap/xtrap right+trap/xtrap only trap/no obstacles.
			</p>
			<p>
				For animation part, we made main menu with animation effect. The camera goes toward the door far away, and a monster crawls when the door opens.
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides, we made long light swing through all the game, so light also shakes, and with horror music, dim light to create terrifying atmosphere.
			</p>
			<p>
				
We also made blood effects. When the hero is hit by hands, there will be blood spout at the collision point.
